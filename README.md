# Predictive Modeling with TensorFlow and Pandas

### Overview
This repository contains Python code for building a predictive model using TensorFlow and Pandas libraries. The model is trained on historical data from TATA Motors (TATAMOTORS.NS) and aims to predict certain outcomes based on the provided features.

### Installation  
To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

TensorFlow|Pandas|Scikit-learn|Pendulum

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```
pip install tensorflow pandas scikit-learn pendulum
```



### Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Ensure that you have Python and the required libraries installed.

Download the historical data file TATAMOTORS.NS.csv and place it in the same directory as the Python scripts.

Run the Python script predictive_model.py to train the model and make predictions.

```
python predictive_model.py

```
